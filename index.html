					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p>I am a dancer, actress, and i love food!.</p>
					<p>Pronouns: She/her</p>
					<p> I have been dancing since I was 5 and this is my first coding class ever and I am very nervouse about it. I am prone to using the creative side of my brain so I think I will be able to use that alot in this class and I will have to get used to using the more analytical side of my brain.</p>
					<p> I am a theatre major and dance minor. I have been doing theatre since third grade and I enjoy making people smile while on stage. One thing that my old theatre teacher used to tell me all the time was that by peroforming we give the audience a gift and I will never fail to remember that because I want the audiences I perform for to leave feeling something, anything every time.</p>
					<p> I am a first year and I will be turning 19 years old this year which is oddly soemthing I've looked foward too my whole life! I cant wait to explore this next chapter of my life and bring everything I have learned here at UCSC with me!</p>
