					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>To be quite honest, this lab was pretty smooth sailing comapred to others with minor mistakes. We think the lecture was very helpful and working directly after the lecture while the information is still fresh in our brains was very strategic.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We dodged a bullet by catching our JS lab in a different folder. We input the car information in Lab 4 instead of lab 5 and thankfully caught it before it became a real issue. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> The last two labs have been so easy to follow and easy to grasp that we haven't had any real road blocks. </p>
